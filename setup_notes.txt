# General Strategy
- I used two machines (two ec2 instances), one for the main domjudge instane, and one for the judgehost
- For the most part I followed the domjudge installation docs

# Extra steps
# Database
- Connect to mysql: mysql -u root -p
- Create mysql user for domjudge: create user 'domjudge'@'localhost' identified by 'xxxxxxx';
- Create database: create database domjudge;
- Grant access to database: grant all privileges on domjudge.* to 'domjudge'@'localhost';

## Judgehost
- run dj_make_chroot /chroot/domjudge amd64
- install in chroot: unzip python python2
- language packages: perl python python3 ruby lua5.2 SWI-Prolog gfortran
- I had to install the languages in the chroot and the host for them to work

# Misc
- Ubuntu seems to have trouble with cgroups when running the judgedaemon. Switching to debian solved all of the problems I had there.
- Misc packages: git curl tmux mosh vim
- Extra packages for domserver on debian: libcurl4-openssl-dev libjsoncpp-dev
- Extra packages for judgehost on debian: libjsoncpp-dev libboost-regex-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libcgroup1 libcgroup-dev
- Required packages for chroot: libgcc1 libc6 libc6-dev python3 ruby swi-prolog perl unzip


- sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev python-dev
- pip install MySQL-python
